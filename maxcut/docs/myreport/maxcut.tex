\subsection{Running time}

The running time of algorithm~R is $\Theta(n + m)$.

\subsection{Randomness}

Algorithm R uses $n$ random bits.

\subsection{Solution quality}

\paragraph{Experiments.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
For the input file  pw09\_100.9.txt with $t=100$ runs, we found
an average cutsize of $C=12064.56$, roughly $88.33$\% of the optimum
$\operatorname{OPT} = 13658$.
The distribution of cutsizes looks as follows:

\input{data/R_pw09_100.9.txt.tex}

\item
For the input file matching\_1000.txt with $t=100$ runs, we found
an average cutsize of $C=249.77$, roughly $49.95$\% of the optimum
$\operatorname{OPT} = 500$.
The distribution of cutsizes looks as follows:

$[\ldots]$
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Analysis of performance guarantee}

Clearly, Algorithm R performs quite badly on input 
  matching\_1000.txt.
We will show that it can perform \emph{no worse} than that, i.e., we
will establish that in expectation, the cutsize $C$ satisfies $C \geq
[\ldots]\cdot \operatorname{OPT}$.\


We will view $C$ as a random variable that gives the size of the cut
defined by the random choices.
Let $W$ denote the total weight of the edges of $G$, i.e.,
\[ W= \sum_{e\in E} w(e)\,.\]

Then,
\begin{equation}\label{eq: E[C]}
E[C] = \textstyle\frac{1}{2}\cdot W\,.
\end{equation}

To see this, define the indicator random variable $X_{uv}$ for every
edge $uv\in E$ as follows.
Set $X_{uv}=1$ if $uv$ crosses the cut, i.e., $u\in A$ and $v\notin A$
or $u\notin A$ and $v\in A$.
Otherwise, $X_{uv} = 0$.

Then, $\Pr(X_{uv} = 1) = [\ldots]$.
Now, $E[C]=[\ldots]$ Finally, we have 
\(E[C]\geq [\ldots]\cdot \text{OPT}\) because clearly
$[\ldots]$.
